2048
Time for implementation - 3 hours
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is a command-line version of the popular game 2048, created using C++.
The game involves sliding numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create
higher-value tiles. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile before the grid fills up
and no more moves can be made.
    The game begins with a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles, with two tiles randomly
placed on the board. The player can move the tiles up, down, left, or right,
and any tiles that are touching and have the same number will combine into a
new tile with double the value. The game continues until either the player
reaches the 2048 tile or the grid fills up and no more moves can be made.During
the game, the player can also view their current score and the highest tile
they have reached so far.
    The code for the game is contained in a single file, 2048.cpp. The main
game loop is implemented in the main function, with separate functions for
handling input, updating the game board, and displaying the grid.The game board
is represented as a two-dimensional array, with each element containing the
value of the corresponding tile. The game logic is implemented using
conditional statements to check for valid moves and combine tiles.
